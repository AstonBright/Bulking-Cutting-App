Fat loss and muscle gain constitute a core component in optimizing athletic performance for competitive athletes and managing health for the general population. However, two major bottlenecks currently impede progress in this domain. First, professional coaching resources are scarce, making it difficult for grassroots athletes and amateur fitness enthusiasts to access real-time, personalized guidance. This often leads to suboptimal training outcomes or injuries due to “blind” or uninformed exercise regimens. Second, while large-scale Transformer-based models have shown promise in assisting with training program design and movement instruction, their substantial parameter counts and high computational demands render them ill-suited for on-device deployment on mobile platforms, which are constrained by limited memory, processing power, and bandwidth. To address these challenges, this study proposes the development of a portable AI coaching system that enhances the scientific rigor and accessibility of fat-loss and muscle-gain training, thereby serving both elite sports performance and public health-oriented fitness needs.
